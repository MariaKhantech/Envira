## Project Description:

Utilizing Amazon Web Services, we have created an environmental app using an AI robot (Envira) to interact with users and read information. Envira is designed to have personality, a fun interactive way to deliver climate change data. A user (company or individual) can also create, join, and search environmentally friendly events. The rating system allows a user to determine the best events to attend. These events help to service the community and do our part in preserving our planet. This app also offers information about air quality, EPA and articles related to climate changes. This is a great app for those concerned about climate change and wants to make a difference.
